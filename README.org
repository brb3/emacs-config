#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration

I'm a big org-mode fan, so in my =~/.emacs.d/init.el= I have a single
line:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org")
#+END_SRC

I have the =config.org= in this repo symlinked to =~/.emacs.d/config.org=. The
above elisp will create and load an elisp file from it.
