#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration

I use the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Prelude]] Emacs "distribution". I'm also a big org-mode fan.
So in my =~/.emacs.d/personal/custom.el= I have a single line:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/personal/init.org")
#+END_SRC

I have the =init.org= in the is repo symlinked to
=~/.emacs.d/personal/init.org=. The above elisp will create and load an
=init.el= file from it.
